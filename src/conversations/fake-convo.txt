 Mode: Telehealth (HIPAA-compliant video)
Molly: Hi John, welcome back. How have you been since last week?
John: Thanks, Molly. It’s been a bit rough. I had a panic attack at work on Monday.
Molly: I'm really sorry to hear that. Do you know what triggered it?
John: I think it was a combination of things—pressure from my manager, a big presentation I had to give, and not sleeping well over the weekend.
Molly: That makes sense. You mentioned last session that you tend to internalize pressure—did you notice any early signs leading up to the panic?
John: Yeah, my chest was tight all morning, and I kept second-guessing everything in the presentation. But I pushed through anyway.
Molly: It sounds like you’re aware of the physical signs now, which is a great step. Let’s spend some time practicing a grounding exercise today and also process how you responded afterward.
[10 minutes of guided grounding and breathwork]
Molly: How did that feel?
John: Honestly, better than I expected. I feel calmer.
Molly: Good. Remember, these are skills you can use in real-time. Let’s also reframe some of the thoughts you had during the episode.
John: Like what?
Molly: Well, when you thought, “I’m going to fail this presentation,” what evidence did you have?
John: None, really. I was just overwhelmed. But in reality, it went okay. No one even noticed I was anxious.
Molly: So a more balanced thought might be, “I felt anxious, but I still did the presentation and no one judged me for it.” Let's write that down.
[Continued work on reframing anxious thought patterns and reviewing homework assignments]
Molly: Before we wrap up, how do you feel about trying sleep hygiene strategies this week to reduce weekend anxiety?
John: Yeah, that’s probably a good idea. I’ll start tracking my bedtime and screen time like you suggested.
Molly: Great. Let’s check in on that next week. I’ll also send you a CBT handout on thought distortions you can review.
John: Thanks, Molly. This helps a lot.
